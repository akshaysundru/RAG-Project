      "A transformer is a practical application of magnetically coupled coils. Usually the purpose is to transfer \n",
      "energy from one coil to the other, as in figure 6-1 where energy is transferred from the AC source to the \n",
      "lamp through the space between the coils. \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 6-1 Transformer principle \n",
      "Transformers are essentially AC devices, because there has to be a change of flux to give an induced \n",
      "voltage in a coil. There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \n",
      " To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \n",
      " To change the voltage and current levels. \n",
      "The coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \n",
      "flux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \n",

      "6.1.2 Practical aspects: \n",
      "The cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \n",

There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling.

There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators.

      " To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \n",
      " To change the voltage and current levels. \n",
      "The coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \n",
