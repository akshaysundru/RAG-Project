      "A transformer is a practical application of magnetically coupled coils. Usually the purpose is to transfer \n",

      "lamp through the space between the coils. \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 6-1 Transformer principle \n",
      "Transformers are essentially AC devices, because there has to be a change of flux to give an induced \n",
      "voltage in a coil. There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \n",
      " To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \n",
      " To change the voltage and current levels. \n",
      "The coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \n",
      "flux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \n",

      "Figure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \n",
      "6.1.2 Practical aspects: \n",

There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators.

There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators. For power frequencies, the cores are made from an iron alloy such as silicon steel.'),\n",

It will be assumed that the coupling is \\nperfect: the same magnetic flux \\uf066 passes through each turn of each coil. The coil connected to the source \\nis termed the primary, and the coil connected to the load is termed the secondary. It is usual to refer to \\nthe coils as windings.\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_2:\\n\\n51 Electrical Machines and Systems                                                                                                            \\n \\n6 Transformer \\n6.1 Introduction: \\nA transformer is a practical application of magnetically coupled coils. Usually the purpose is to transfer \\nenergy from one coil to the other, as in figure 6-1 where energy is transferred from the AC source to the \\nlamp through the space between the coils. \\n \\nFigure 6-1 Transformer principle \\nTransformers are essentially AC devices, because there has to be a change of flux to give an induced \\nvoltage in a coil. There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators. For power frequencies, the cores are made from an iron alloy such as silicon steel.\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_3:\\n\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡        (6 − 3) \\n𝑣2 = 𝑅2𝑖2 + 𝑁2\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡                               (6 − 4) \\nThe sign difference arises from the reference directions for current in the two windings. \\nIf the resistances R1 and R2 are negligible, then equations 6-3 and 6-4 become: \\n𝑣1 ≈ 𝑁1\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡          (6 − 5) \\n𝑣2 ≈ 𝑁2\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡         (6 − 6) \\nDividing these equations gives the important result: \\n𝑣1\\n𝑣2\\n≈ 𝑁1\\n𝑁2\\n        (6 − 7) \\nThus, the secondary voltage can be made larger or smaller than the primary voltage by changing the \\nratio of the numbers of turns on the two windings. Voltage transformation is one of the most common \\nuses of transformers, on a large scale in electrical power transmission and distribution, and on a small \\nscale in the power supplies for electronic equipment. \\n6.2.2 Sinusoidal operation: \\nIf the voltage source is sinusoidal, then the core flux will also be sinusoidal, so we may put:\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_4:\\n\\n𝑽𝒔 = 𝑽𝟏 + 𝑽𝟐 = 𝟐𝑽𝟐 = 𝟐𝑽𝑳        (6 − 22) \\n𝑰𝑳 = 𝑰𝟏 + 𝑰𝟐 = 𝟐𝑰𝟏 = 𝟐𝑰𝑳            (6 − 23) \\nWhere VL is the voltage across the load and IS is the current supplied by the source. This auto-wound \\ntransformer behaves as a step-down transformer with a ratio of 2:1, and the current in each winding is \\nequal to half of the load current. \\nAn elegant application of the auto-wound transformer principle is the variable transformer, which has a \\nsingle-layer coil wound on a toroidal core. The output is taken from a carbon brush that makes contact \\nwith the surface of the coil; the brush can be moved smoothly from one end of the coil to the other, thus \\nvarying the output voltage. Examples of variable transformers are shown in figure 6-10. \\n \\n     \\n      Figure 6-10 Variable transformers. \\n \\n \\n \\n6.3.2 3 Phase Transformer: \\nIn 3 -phase systems, it is common practice to use sets of three single -phase transformers. It is also \\npossible, however, to make 3 -phase transformers with three sets of windings on three limbs of a core, \\nas shown in figure 6-11. \\n \\nFigure 6-11 3-phase transformer model\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_5:\\n\\n65 Electrical Machines and Systems                                                                                                            \\n6.8 Current Transformers \\nInstrument transformers are special transformers for extending the range of measur ing instruments. \\nThere are two basic types: voltage transformers for measuring high voltages, and current transformers \\nfor measuring high currents. Using transformers for voltage measurement is similar in principle to the \\nordinary use of transformers to ch ange voltage levels, so it will not be considered further. Current \\ntransformers, on the other hand, need special consideration. These are usually toroidal transformers with \\nhigh-quality core material. \\nFigure 6-25 shows a load connected to a source. The primary of a current transformer is in series with \\nthe load, and the secondary is connected to a meter \\n  \\nFigure 6-25 Use of a current transformer \\n \\n \\nEquation 6-19 gives: \\n𝐼𝑀 ≈ 𝑁1\\n𝑁2\\n𝐼𝐿     𝑜𝑟  𝐼𝐿 ≈ 𝑁1\\n𝑁2\\n𝐼𝑀           (6 − 53)\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_6:\\n\\n31. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 6-31 E I laminations \\nThe center limb is twice the width of the outer limbs because it carries twice the flux, as shown by \\nthe flux plot in figure 6-32. \\n \\nFigure 6-32  Flux Plot: Shell type transformer \\nThe coils are wound on a bobbin that fits the center limb of the core, and the core is assembled \\nby inserting E laminations alternately from each side and adding matching I laminations. \\nDimensions are chosen so that two E and two I laminations can be punched from a rectangular steel \\nsheet without any waste. Current flowing in the resistance of the transformer windings will produce \\nheat, which must escape through the surface of the windings. In addition, there will be power loss in \\nthe core, which also appears as heat. \\nThe power output from a given size of transformer is governed by the rate at which heat can be \\nremoved. Large transformers are usually cooled by circulating oil, but small transformers rely on\\n\\n\\n',\n",
