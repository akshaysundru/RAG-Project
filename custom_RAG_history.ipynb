      "A transformer is a practical application of magnetically coupled coils. Usually the purpose is to transfer \n",

      "lamp through the space between the coils. \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 6-1 Transformer principle \n",
      "Transformers are essentially AC devices, because there has to be a change of flux to give an induced \n",
      "voltage in a coil. There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \n",
      " To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \n",
      " To change the voltage and current levels. \n",
      "The coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \n",
      "flux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \n",

There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators.

There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators. For power frequencies, the cores are made from an iron alloy such as silicon steel.'),\n",

Usually the purpose is to transfer \\nenergy from one coil to the other, as in figure 6-1 where energy is transferred from the AC source to the \\nlamp through the space between the coils. \\n \\nFigure 6-1 Transformer principle \\nTransformers are essentially AC devices, because there has to be a change of flux to give an induced \\nvoltage in a coil. There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators. For power frequencies, the cores are made from an iron alloy such as silicon steel.\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_4:\\n\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡        (6 − 3) \\n𝑣2 = 𝑅2𝑖2 + 𝑁2\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡                               (6 − 4) \\nThe sign difference arises from the reference directions for current in the two windings. \\nIf the resistances R1 and R2 are negligible, then equations 6-3 and 6-4 become: \\n𝑣1 ≈ 𝑁1\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡          (6 − 5) \\n𝑣2 ≈ 𝑁2\\n𝑑𝜙\\n𝑑𝑡         (6 − 6) \\nDividing these equations gives the important result: \\n𝑣1\\n𝑣2\\n≈ 𝑁1\\n𝑁2\\n        (6 − 7) \\nThus, the secondary voltage can be made larger or smaller than the primary voltage by changing the \\nratio of the numbers of turns on the two windings. Voltage transformation is one of the most common \\nuses of transformers, on a large scale in electrical power transmission and distribution, and on a small \\nscale in the power supplies for electronic equipment. \\n6.2.2 Sinusoidal operation: \\nIf the voltage source is sinusoidal, then the core flux will also be sinusoidal, so we may put:\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_5:\\n\\n𝑽𝒔 = 𝑽𝟏 + 𝑽𝟐 = 𝟐𝑽𝟐 = 𝟐𝑽𝑳        (6 − 22) \\n𝑰𝑳 = 𝑰𝟏 + 𝑰𝟐 = 𝟐𝑰𝟏 = 𝟐𝑰𝑳            (6 − 23) \\nWhere VL is the voltage across the load and IS is the current supplied by the source. This auto-wound \\ntransformer behaves as a step-down transformer with a ratio of 2:1, and the current in each winding is \\nequal to half of the load current. \\nAn elegant application of the auto-wound transformer principle is the variable transformer, which has a \\nsingle-layer coil wound on a toroidal core. The output is taken from a carbon brush that makes contact \\nwith the surface of the coil; the brush can be moved smoothly from one end of the coil to the other, thus \\nvarying the output voltage. Examples of variable transformers are shown in figure 6-10. \\n \\n     \\n      Figure 6-10 Variable transformers. \\n \\n \\n \\n6.3.2 3 Phase Transformer: \\nIn 3 -phase systems, it is common practice to use sets of three single -phase transformers. It is also \\npossible, however, to make 3 -phase transformers with three sets of windings on three limbs of a core, \\nas shown in figure 6-11. \\n \\nFigure 6-11 3-phase transformer model\\n\\n\\n\\nChunk_6:\\n\\n31. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 6-31 E I laminations \\nThe center limb is twice the width of the outer limbs because it carries twice the flux, as shown by \\nthe flux plot in figure 6-32. \\n \\nFigure 6-32  Flux Plot: Shell type transformer \\nThe coils are wound on a bobbin that fits the center limb of the core, and the core is assembled \\nby inserting E laminations alternately from each side and adding matching I laminations. \\nDimensions are chosen so that two E and two I laminations can be punched from a rectangular steel \\nsheet without any waste. Current flowing in the resistance of the transformer windings will produce \\nheat, which must escape through the surface of the windings. In addition, there will be power loss in \\nthe core, which also appears as heat. \\nThe power output from a given size of transformer is governed by the rate at which heat can be \\nremoved. Large transformers are usually cooled by circulating oil, but small transformers rely on\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It follows that the direction of rotation depends on the phase sequence of the 3-phase supply, since interchanging any pair of phases has the effect of reversing the phase sequence (see section 4-1). Therefore, it is important to know the phase sequence of the supply before connecting the motor. \n",

      "    (5-15) This can result in a large third-harmonic circulating current. Similar considerations apply to higher harmonics where the harmonic number is a multiple of 3; these are known as triplen harmonics. Therefore, it is normal practice to connect the windings of a synchronous machine in star.  It is possible to eliminate any harmonic from the voltage waveform by using short-pitched coils in the stator winding. Short-pitched coils span less than a pole pitch; the coils shown in figure 4-6 are of this form. It may be shown that, if the coil is short-pitched by a fraction 1/n of the pole pitch, then the nth harmonic will be eliminated from the voltage waveform. For example, in a 2-pole machine, if the coils span 120º instead of 180º, so that they are short-pitched by 1/3, the third harmonic will be eliminated. In this particular case, it is permissible to connect the windings in delta. It is more usual, however, to short-pitch by 1/6, as shown in figure 4-6, since this reduces the fifth and seventh harmonics to low levels. If the windings are star connected, all the triplen harmonics are eliminated, so the resulting voltage waveform is a good approximation to a sine wave. Salient-pole machine theory It is possible to analyse the salient-pole machine by resolving the armature flux into two components: a component acting along the rotor d-axis, and a component acting along the q-axis [3, 4]. This is represented in the phasor diagram by resolving the current I into components Id and Iq. The component Id acts on the d-axis, where the low reluctance gives a correspondingly high reactance\n",

      "7 STEPPER MOTORS 7.1 Introduction The conventional AC and DC machines are designed for continuous rotation of a shaft. It is often desirable to control the speed, but most applications do not require precise control of the angular position.  Specialised applications such as automation systems do require this kind of control. Often it is achieved with a feedback control system incorporating a position sensor, a drive motor, and a controller. The position measured by the sensor is compared with the desired value, and the difference used to control the motor until the error is acceptably small. AC and DC motors used in this way are termed servomotors, but they will not be considered further in this course.  Another way of achieving position control is to use a special type of motor known as a stepping motor or stepper motor. These motors are not designed primarily for continuous rotation, although they can work in this way if required. Instead, they are designed to turn the output shaft through a precise angle whenever the currents in the windings are switched in a particular way by an electronic driver. Each switching action results in one increment or step in the rotor position.  There are three basic types of stepper motor: simple permanent-magnet, variable-reluctance, and hybrid. Simple permanent-magnet stepper motors are similar to permanent-magnet synchronous motors, except that the stator currents are switched instead of varying continuously. They are no longer widely used, and they will not be considered further.  Variable-reluctance stepper motors are simple applications of the variable-reluctance principle introduced in section 7.2. They do not contain magnets, and they are easy to control, but they have relatively large step angles. A variant of the variable-reluctance stepper motor is the switched reluctance motor, which is designed for continuous rotation.\n",

      "Most of the AC generators in electric power systems are synchronous machines. High-speed turbine generators normally have two poles. The rotor is made from a cylindrical steel forging, with the field winding embedded in slots machined in the steel. Apart from the slots for conductors, the active surfaces of the stator and rotor are cylindrical, so these are uniform-airgap or non-salient machines.  Low-speed hydro generators have many poles. These are salient-pole machines, where the poles radiate like spokes from a central hub. Synchronous generators will not be considered in detail in this course, but will be studied in the context of power systems in year 3.  Large synchronous motors are widely used as high-efficiency constant-speed industrial drives, where they can also be used for plant power factor correction: see section 5.2. These are normally salient-pole machines, and they generally have four or more poles.  The main features of synchronous machine operation can be deduced from the simple theory of non-salient machines. An introduction to salient-pole machines is given in section 5.3. 5.2 Characteristics Circuit model A non-salient synchronous machine can be represented by a simple equivalent circuit [3, 4], shown in figure 5-4. jXsRaIV+ E+V+  Figure 5-4:  Equivalent circuit. This circuit represents one phase of a 3-phase machine. The voltage V is the phase voltage at the machine terminals, and the current I is the corresponding phase current.

      "7 STEPPER MOTORS 7.1 Introduction The conventional AC and DC machines are designed for continuous rotation of a shaft. It is often desirable to control the speed, but most applications do not require precise control of the angular position.  Specialised applications such as automation systems do require this kind of control. Often it is achieved with a feedback control system incorporating a position sensor, a drive motor, and a controller. The position measured by the sensor is compared with the desired value, and the difference used to control the motor until the error is acceptably small. AC and DC motors used in this way are termed servomotors, but they will not be considered further in this course.  Another way of achieving position control is to use a special type of motor known as a stepping motor or stepper motor. These motors are not designed primarily for continuous rotation, although they can work in this way if required. Instead, they are designed to turn the output shaft through a precise angle whenever the currents in the windings are switched in a particular way by an electronic driver. Each switching action results in one increment or step in the rotor position.  There are three basic types of stepper motor: simple permanent-magnet, variable-reluctance, and hybrid. Simple permanent-magnet stepper motors are similar to permanent-magnet synchronous motors, except that the stator currents are switched instead of varying continuously. They are no longer widely used, and they will not be considered further.  Variable-reluctance stepper motors are simple applications of the variable-reluctance principle introduced in section 7.2. They do not contain magnets, and they are easy to control, but they have relatively large step angles. A variant of the variable-reluctance stepper motor is the switched reluctance motor, which is designed for continuous rotation.\n",

In either case, the requirement is a symmetrical set of sinusoidal currents with relative phase displacements of 120º.

While transformers are commonly used for voltage transformation, DC machines are often used for power transmission, industrial control, and other applications where DC power is required.\\n\\n**Advantages of Three-Phase AC Systems**\\n\\nThree-phase AC systems offer several advantages over single-phase systems:\\n\\n* Efficient energy transmission over long distances\\n* Reduced energy losses compared to single-phase systems\\n* Ability to transmit high power levels with reduced energy loss\\n\\n**Materials Used in Transformers**\\n\\nTransformers typically consist of the following materials:\\n\\n* Magnetic core material: steel or ferrite\\n* Electrical insulation: varnished paper or fiberglass\\n\\nThese materials are used to create the primary and secondary coils, which carry the electrical current and induce a voltage through electromagnetic induction.\\n\\nInformation was pulled from: ENSC3016_Course_Notes_Part_1_Electromagnetism_Transformers.pdf: pages 57, 69, 65;', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]"
