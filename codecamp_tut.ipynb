J. Thomson experiment that discovered the electron. \\n5.2. The Hall Effect \\nIn a conductor, when there is no current through it, the electrons move randomly with no \\nnet or average motion in any direction. When a current is passed through the conductor, \\nthe electrons continue to move randomly, but with an average drift in the opposite \\ndirection to the electric field causing the current. The drift speed 𝑣𝑑 is very smaller \\ncompared with the speed of the electrons in their individual random motion. In a copper \\nwire at room temperature, the electrons are randomly moving at around 106 m/s, while the \\ndrift speed is only around 10-4 m/s (i.e. on the order of centimetres per hour). \\nIn 1879, Edwin H. Hall showed that the drifting conduction electrons in a copper wire can be \\ndeflected by an outside magnetic field. This is the Hall Effect and is used in a wide range of \\nsensor technology. \\nImagine a copper strip with current flowing down the page. The electrons then drift up the \\npage. If we apply a magnetic field pointing into the page, the force due to the magnetic field \\nwill deflect the electrons to the right-hand edge of the strip. \\nThis caused a greater density of electrons at the right-hand edge of the strip, and so a \\nseparation of charges that produces an electric field within the strip. The force on the \\nelectrons due to the electric field (equivalently, their own mutual repulsion) will eventually \\ncancel the force due to the magnetic field, resulting in a maximum value of the electric field. \\nThe electric field results in a potential difference across the strip, which can be measured \\nwith a voltmeter. \\nIn addition to allowing us to determine things such as whether the moving charges within a \\nconductor are positive or negative, and measure the drift speed of electrons (if we move the \\nstrip through the magnetic field with same speed as the electron drift, but in the opposite \\ndirection, the Hall Effect voltage will be zero), we can create a device where the output'),\n",
