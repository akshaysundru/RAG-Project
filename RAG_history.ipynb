There are two main reasons for transferring energy in this way: \\n\\uf0b7 To provide electrical isolation between the source and the load. \\n\\uf0b7 To change the voltage and current levels. \\nThe coils are usually placed on a common magnetic core to improve the coupling. Figure 6-2 shows the \\nflux plots for two coupled coils (a) without a core, (b) with an open core, (c) with a closed core \\n \\nFigure 6-2 Effect of a magnetic core: \\n6.1.2 Practical aspects: \\nThe cores for high -frequency transformers are often made from magnetically soft ferrites, which are \\nelectrical insulators. For power frequencies, the cores are made from an iron alloy such as silicon steel.'),\n",

      "In a typical AC machine, such as an induction motor or generator, the stator carries a three-phase winding, which produces a rotating magnetic field. The rotor is also connected to a three-phase winding, which interacts with the rotating magnetic field.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the rotor rotates, it induces a voltage in its own winding, generating electricity. This process continues as long as the machine is connected to a power source and the rotor remains rotating.\n",

      "Some common types of AC machines include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Induction motors: Use electromagnetic induction to generate torque.\n",
      "* Synchronous motors: Use a direct current magnetic field to rotate the rotor.\n",
      "* Induction generators: Use electromagnetic induction to generate electricity.\n",
      "* Reluctance motors: Use the reluctance of magnetic materials to generate torque.\n",
