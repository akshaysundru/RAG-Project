      "**Classical Computers**\n",
      "\n",
      "Our current computers use something called \"bits\" to store and process information. A bit can be either 0 or 1, like a light switch that's either on or off. When you combine these bits, you get binary code that our brains can understand.\n",

      "**Quantum Computers**\n",

      "A quantum computer uses something called \"qubits\" (quantum bits). Qubits are special because they can be both 0 and 1 at the same time! It's like a light switch that can be on and off simultaneously. This means qubits can process many possibilities simultaneously, making them super fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine trying to find a specific book in a huge library. A classical computer would look through each book one by one, saying \"is this it?\" while a quantum computer could instantly check all the books at once, using its qubits to explore every possibility simultaneously!\n",

      "Quantum computers use something called superposition, entanglement, and interference to process information. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Superposition**: Qubits can exist in multiple states (0 or 1) at the same time.\n",
      "2. **Entanglement**: Qubits can be connected in such a way that their states are linked, even when they're far apart.\n",
      "3. **Interference**: When qubits interact with each other or their environment, they can create patterns of probability that reveal hidden information.\n",

      "Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are too complex or time-consuming for classical computers. Some examples include:\n",
