Summary \\nThis lecture will cover Faraday’s law, Lenz’s law, and induction and energy transfer. \\nConsider a loop of conducting wire connected to an ammeter. If we move a bar magnet \\ntowards the loop, we will observe: \\n1. A current appears only when the magnetic is moving relative to the loop. \\n2. Faster movement causes a greater current. \\n3. The direction of current differs depending on whether the north or south pole of the \\nmagnet is towards the loop. \\nThe current produced in the loop is called induced current. The work done per unit charge \\nto produce the current is called the induced emf.  \\nIf we use a second loop of conducting wire connected to a current source (battery) to \\ngenerate a magnetic dipole near the loop connected to the ammeter, we observe the same \\nactions as above with the addition that: \\n4. A current is only observed in the first loop when during brief periods when the \\ncurrent in the second loop is switch on an off. No induced current is observed in the \\nfirst loop when the current in the second loop is in a steady state. \\n \\nFigure 1: A bar magnetic being used to induced a current in a coil.
